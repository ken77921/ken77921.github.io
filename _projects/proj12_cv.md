<p>
    We formulated our objective function at the superpixel level rather than the pixel level as the traditional optical flow method did.

    Our method achieves better large displacement matching capability than LDOF in videos with lower quality , and has been accepted to ICIP 2013 (<a href="https://f6d60bef-de96-4b94-b613-4913f88f2f0f.filesusr.com/ugd/e150d8_71ff29f7b6fc4c45822bb2e097dd0b45.pdf">Paper</a>, <a href="https://f6d60bef-de96-4b94-b613-4913f88f2f0f.filesusr.com/ugd/e150d8_4e98e9d181694a5f9724a6698a1dac98.pdf">Poster</a>).
