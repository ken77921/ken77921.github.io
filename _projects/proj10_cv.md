<p>
    We proposed a general framework which applies classifiers with different complexity to discriminate segments in an image.

    Our unsupervisedhierarchical segmentation results achieve similar or better performance in several standard benchmarks compared with the current state-of-the-art methods based on learning, and has been accepted to ACCV 2014 (<a href="https://f6d60bef-de96-4b94-b613-4913f88f2f0f.filesusr.com/ugd/e150d8_242e704833024ea4a6723dfd884e85ff.pdf">Paper</a>, <a href="https://f6d60bef-de96-4b94-b613-4913f88f2f0f.filesusr.com/ugd/e150d8_f6c41538d19a4788a7efd64ffcfd01be.pdf">Poster</a>).
