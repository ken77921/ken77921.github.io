<p>
    We proposed an efficient algorithm which decomposes the unsupervised Multiple Foreground Co-segmentation problem into three sub-problems: segmentation, matching and figure-ground classification.
    Our method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art method by 13% in a standard benchmark, and has been accepted by CVIU (<a href="https://f6d60bef-de96-4b94-b613-4913f88f2f0f.filesusr.com/ugd/e150d8_6e352dd41985407bb5db08b256f1d333.pdf">Paper</a>)
