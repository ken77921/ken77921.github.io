I am a postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amehrst Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR), advised by <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/">Hamed Zamani</a>. I am interested in fundamentally narrowing the gap between large language models (LLMs) and human intelligence without relying on scaling laws such as increasing model size or training data. My current focus includes (1) enhancing the generation factuality, diversity, and novelty of LLMs by encouraging the usage of more causal inferences and less guesses, (2) discovering LLMs' limitations in their current architecture, decoding algorithms, evaluation, and training data, and (3) overcoming the limitations through the techniques inspired by human behavior, machine learning (ML), and information retrieval (IR). 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon AGI Foundations and worked with <a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Violet Peng</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/">Mohit Bansal</a>. I got my PhD at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> advised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>.  I worked with <a href="http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html">Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</a> and Kuan-Ta Chen in <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en">Academia Sinica, Taiwan</a>. I received BS in <a href="https://eecshp.nycu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction?locale=en">EECS Undergraduate Honors Program</a> from <a href="https://en.nycu.edu.tw/">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan</a>.
