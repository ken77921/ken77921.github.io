I am a postdoc in the faculty job market now. My current position is a postdoctoral research associate at UMass Amherst Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR), advised by <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/">Hamed Zamani</a>. I am broadly interested in developing intelligent systems that could assist humans in their creative process. Currently, I focus on fundamentally narrowing the gap between large language models (LLMs) and human intelligence without relying on scaling laws such as increasing model size or training data. Toward that end, I am particularly interested in <br>
(1) enhancing the generation factuality, diversity, and novelty of LLMs by encouraging the usage of more causal inferences and fewer guesses, <br>
(2) discovering LLMs' limitations in their current architectures, decoding algorithms, evaluation, and training data, and <br>
(3) overcoming the limitations through the techniques inspired by human behavior, machine learning (ML), and information retrieval (IR).


Previously, I was a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon AGI Foundations and worked with <a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Violet Peng</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/">Mohit Bansal</a>, and Tagyoung Chung. I got my PhD at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>. Prior to PhD, I worked with <a href="http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html">Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</a> and Kuan-Ta Chen at <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en">Academia Sinica, Taiwan</a>. I received my BS in the EECS Undergraduate Honors Program from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan.
