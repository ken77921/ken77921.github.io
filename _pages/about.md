I am a postdoctoral scientist at UMass Amehrst CIIR, advised by <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/">Hamed Zamani</a>. My current research goal is to reduce the hallucination of LLMs in fundamental ways. I am especially interested in 1) identifying if the next word generated by a LLM comes from LLM's guess, memory, or causal inference, and 2) designing the knowledge representations that facilitate the communication between humans and LLMs. Previously, I was a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon AGI Foundations and worked with <a href="https://vnpeng.net/">Violet Peng</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~mbansal/">Mohit Bansal</a>. I got my PhD at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> advised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>.  I worked with <a href="http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html">Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</a> and Kuan-Ta Chen in <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en">Academia Sinica, Taiwan</a>. I received BS in <a href="https://eecshp.nycu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction?locale=en">EECS Undergraduate Honors Program</a> from <a href="https://en.nycu.edu.tw/">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan</a>.
