I am a postdoctoral scientist at Amazon. My current research goal is to reduce the hallucination of LLMs in fundamental ways. Previously, I got my PhD at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> advised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>.  I worked with <a href="http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html">Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</a> and Kuan-Ta Chen in <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en">Academia Sinica, Taiwan</a>. I received BS in <a href="https://eecshp.nycu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction?locale=en">EECS Undergraduate Honors Program</a> from <a href="https://en.nycu.edu.tw/">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan</a>.
