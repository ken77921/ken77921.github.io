I am seeking Postdoc positions starting Summer/Fall 2022. I'm currently in my final year of my PhD at the <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> advised by Professor <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>. 

My primary research goal is to build accurate semantic models of textual similarity and entailment in order to help knowledge workers efficiently navigate large text collections. To approach this goal, I addressed some fundamental limitations of self-supervised language models and active learning methods; I developed a state-of-the-art review-paper affinity estimation model that is adopted by <a href="https://openreview.net/">OpenReview</a> and used by many conferences, including ICLR and NeurIPS; I also developed unsupervised methods for hypernym detection and crowdsourcing methods for educational prerequisite estimation.

Previously, I worked with <a href="http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/members.html">Yu-Chiang Frank Wang</a> and Kuan-Ta Chen in <a href="https://www.sinica.edu.tw/en">Academia Sinica, Taiwan</a>. I received BS in <a href="https://eecshp.nycu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction?locale=en">EECS Undergraduate Honors Program</a> from <a href="https://en.nycu.edu.tw/">National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU), Taiwan</a>.
