  <h2>Multi-facet Embedding for Language Modeling</h2>

<h4>Why Multiple Embeddings are Better in LM's Output Softmax Layer</h4>

      We theoretically show that this single hidden state cannot produce all probability distributions regardless of the language model (LM) size or training data size because the single hidden state embedding cannot be close to the embeddings of all the possible next words simultaneously when there are other interfering word embeddings between them. Our work not only deepens our understanding of softmax bottleneck and mixture of softmax (MoS) but also inspires us to propose multi-facet softmax (MFS) to address the limitations of MoS (<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=n0jZ0QyXzj">Paper</a>).

      We design a framework that displays multiple candidate upcoming topics, of which a user can select a subset to guide the generation. Our framework consists of two components: (1) a method that produces a set of candidate topics by predicting the centers of word clusters in the possible continuations, and (2) a text generation model whose output adheres to the chosen topics. The training of both components is self-supervised, using only unlabeled text. Our experiments demonstrate that our topic options are better than those of standard clustering approaches, and our framework often generates fluent sentences related to the chosen topics, as judged by automated metrics and crowdsourced workers

      We propose multi-facet universal schema that uses a neural model to represent each sentence pattern as multiple facet embeddings and encourage one of these facet embeddings to be close to that of another sentence pattern if they cooccur with the same entity pair. In our experiments, we demonstrate that multi-facet embeddings significantly outperform their single facet embedding counterpart, compositional universal schema (Verga et al., 2016), in distantly supervised relation extraction tasks. Moreover, we can also use multiple embeddings to detect the entailment relation between two sentence patterns when no manual label is available

      We propose a novel embedding method for a text sequence (e.g., a sentence) where each sequence is represented by a distinct set of multi-mode codebook embeddings to capture different semantic facets of its meaning. The codebook embeddings can be viewed as the cluster centers which summarize the distribution of possibly co-occurring words in a pre-trained word embedding space. Our experiments show that the per-sentence codebook embeddings significantly improve the performances in unsupervised sentence similarity and extractive summarization benchmarks (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15330">Paper</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k-OBWdBYsGmXUuvNc1_J_JrEppB_Aqh82bJPCgjFL-s/edit?usp=sharing">Slides</a>, <a href="../assets/pdf/proj3-nlp-Multi-facet Embeddings for Sentence Representation-poster.pdf" download="poster-aaai2021-Extending Multi-sense Word Embedding to Phrases and Sentences for Unsupervised Semantic Applications">Poster</a>).

  <h4>Overcoming Practical Issues of Deep Active Learning</h4>

      Existing deep active learning algorithms achieve impressive sampling efficiency on natural language processing tasks. However, they exhibit several weaknesses in practice, including (a) inability to use uncertainty sampling with black-box models, (b) lack of robustness to noise in labeling, (c) lack of transparency. In response, we propose a transparent batch active sampling framework by estimating the error decay curves of multiple feature-defined subsets of the data. We perform extensive experiments on four named entity recognition (NER) tasks and results show that our methods greatly alleviate these limitations without sacrificing too much sampling efficiency

      We propose a novel word embedding method that preserves the distributional inclusion property in the sparse-bag-of-word (SBOW) feature. The embedding can be used to predict the generality of words, detect the hypernym relation, and discover the topics from the raw text simultaneously. The extensive experiments show that the embedding effectively compresses the SBOW, and achieves new state-of-the-art performances on the unsupervised hypernym detection tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00880">Paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iesl/Distributional-Inclusion-Vector-Embedding">Code</a>, <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/chsu5358/raw/f08d4755b0f04e113c139a72a977df5c/">Demo</a>, <a href="../assets/pdf/proj5-nlp-DIVE-poster.pdf" download="poster-naacl2018-Distributional Inclusion Vector Embedding for Unsupervised Hypernymy Detection">Poster</a>).
