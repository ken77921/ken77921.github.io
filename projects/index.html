The proposed alternatives achieve better perplexity than the mixture of softmax (MoS), especially given an ambiguous context, without adding significant computational cost to LMs. Our approaches also let GPT-2 learn to properly copy the entities from the context, which increases the coherence of the generated text without requiring any labels. In addition to predicting the next word, we also use multiple CLS embeddings to improve state-of-the-art pretraining methods for BERT on natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks without introducing significant extra parameters or computations, especially when the training datasets are small. Furthermore, we show that our multi-facet embeddings improve the sequential recommendation, scientific paper embeddings, distantly supervised relation extraction, and cold-start citation recommendation.

By only making some simple modifications on the output softmax layer for SASRec and GRU4Rec, softmax-CPR achieves consistent improvement in 12 datasets. With almost the same model size, our best method not only improves the average NDCG@10 of GRU4Rec in 5 datasets with duplicated items by 10% (4%-17% individually) but also improves 7 datasets without duplicated items by 24% (8%-39%)!

By combining these softmax alternatives, softmax-CPR is significantly better and more efficient than mixture of softmax (MoS) in GPT-2, a state-of-the-art softmax alternative. In summarization experiments, without significantly decreasing its training/testing speed, softmax-CEPR based on T5-Small improves factCC score by 2 points in CNN/DM and XSUM dataset, and improves MAUVE scores by around 30% in BookSum paragraph-level dataset.

Multi-CLS BERT uses multiple CLS tokens with a parameterization and objective that encourages their diversity. Thus instead of fine-tuning each BERT model in an ensemble (and running them all at test time), we need only fine-tune our single Multi-CLS BERT model (and run the one model at test time, ensembling just the multiple final CLS embeddings). To test its effectiveness, we build Multi-CLS BERT on top of a state-of-the-art pretraining method for BERT (Aroca-Ouellette and Rudzicz, 2020). In experiments on GLUE and SuperGLUE we show that our Multi-CLS BERT reliably improves both overall accuracy and confidence estimation. When only 100 training samples are available in GLUE, the Multi-CLS BERT_Base model can even outperform the corresponding BERT_Large model. We analyze the behavior of our Multi-CLS BERT, showing that it has many of the same characteristics and behavior as a typical BERT 5-way ensemble, but with nearly 4-times less computation and memory.

By increasing the number of requirements/constraints in the prompt, we can increase the prompt specificity and hinder LLMs from retelling high-quality narratives in their training data. Consequently, CS4 empowers us to indirectly measure the LLMs' creativity without human annotations. </p> <p> Our experiments on LLaMA, Gemma, and Mistral not only highlight the creativity challenges LLMs face when dealing with highly specific prompts but also reveal that different LLMs perform very differently under different numbers of constraints and achieve different balances between the model's instruction-following ability and narrative coherence.

Motivated by these limitations, we propose a coarse-to-fine (C2F) tree-based story generation framework, which is called C2F-StoryTree, where the LM iteratively generates more and more specific story prompts based on a user’s input prompt and the desired plot selected by the user. To realize our C2F-StoryTree framework, we propose an entailment hierarchy (EH) text structure, in which a more specific response entails more general prompt (e.g., a story entails a summary). We also propose novel annotation tasks, decoding methods, and a human-and-machine-in-the-loop procedure to minimize the annotation cost of building the text structure.

Experimental results on six datasets show that our methods reliably improve accuracy in various network architectures, including additional gains on top of other popular training techniques (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07433" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paper</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07433" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Poster</a>). </p> </div> </div> <p><br></p> <hr> <div class="div-cat-header"> <h2 id="header-NLP">Natural Language Processing</h2> </div> <p><br></p> <h4>Distributional Inclusion Vector Embedding for Unsupevised Hypernym Detection</h4> <div class="row row-grid"> <div class="col-6"> <img src="../assets/img/proj5-nlp-DIVE.png" class="img-responsive" width="100%"> </div> <div class="col"> <p> We propose a novel word embedding method that preserves the distributional inclusion property in the sparse-bag-of-word (SBOW) feature. The embedding can be used to predict the generality of words, detect the hypernym relation, and discover the topics from the raw text simultaneously. The extensive experiments show that the embedding effectively compresses the SBOW, and achieves new state-of-the-art performances on the unsupervised hypernym detection tasks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00880" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/iesl/Distributional-Inclusion-Vector-Embedding" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Code</a>, <a href="../assets/pdf/proj5-nlp-DIVE-poster.pdf" download="poster-naacl2018-Distributional Inclusion Vector Embedding for Unsupervised Hypernymy Detection">Poster</a>).
